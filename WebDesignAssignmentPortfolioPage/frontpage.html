    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
    <h3>Bad half</h3>
    <p>I began studying in 2018 September. I enrolled in the University of Calgary in the Fall semester in natural sciences then I transferred into computer science within the first year or the second year. I was not a diligent student, calculus and physics were easy because I had already done those in highschool but everything else was hard and boring because I didn't really care about it and I did not study. German language classes were interesting. I took photography, photo and video editing, and 3D modelling as options.</p><br>

    <h3>Good half</h3>
    <p>My family moved to Windsor, Ontario across the Detroit River from Detroit, at that time Jesus Christ changed me and saved me, and I started to know God. After I started studying at the University of Windsor (because I had transferred my bachelor degree studies) I found great interest in working hard for the sake of respecting the gifts God gave me and obeying God and enjoying his wisdom in my life. Because of that I became more interested in my studies, I find logic and proofs to be the most interesting subject, I am not very creative, but I like the more math oriented parts of computer science, although I think they are harder. Databases are interesting to me as well.</p><br><br>
