At [https://ebible.org/study/](https://ebible.org/study/) you can find old paintings and engravings made to depict scenes described by the bible.\
I looked through the HTML and found that all the images for the artwork are stored in the same directory which was accessible at this URL: [here](https://ebible.org/study/content/media/images/)\
I wanted to create a reference resource that I could search for pictures so I wrote this small HTML program to display them all in a gallery.\
I used a python script to write the tedious part of the HTML.
