    <h2>Work I've done</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/ZouraCodeSamples/tree/main/KNearestNeighboursDiscrete">K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm</a><br>
	<p>In a course called AI Concepts I implemented the k-nearest-neighbours algorithm to look at a 19 attributes of a mushroom and determine whether it is poisonous or not, using a mushroom dataset from UC Irvine archives to train and test.</p><br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/ZouraCodeSamples/tree/main/AudioManipulation">Audio formatter and splitter</a><br>

	<a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/ZouraCodeSamples/tree/main/BibleArtGallery">Bible Art Gallery</a><br>
	<p>After discovering an online bible reader that embedded artwork of scenes recorded in the bible, I made a gallery to reference the art.</p><br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/GSP-SP-OP-GraphRecognition">Iterative Depth First Search</a>
	<p>In a two semester long course at the University of Windsor I was given the project of implementing Dr. Yung Tsins graph classifer certifying aglorithm. I got as far as implementing iterative depth first search.</p><br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/PasswordFeaturesComp4730AbrahamlingamDagatiZoura">Password Feature Importance Ranking</a>
	<p>A class group project in which we attempted to discover whether neural networks' weight vectors can be used to rank the importance of features for predicting the strength of a password.</p><br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/PeterZoura/233Group3Project/tree/Demo-3">Clone of the game Slay the Spire</a>
	<p>In my second semester of my computer science degree (in Calgary, Alberta) the class was given a group project which was "to make any interactive media in Java". I didn't know anything at the time but I had good group members who knew a lot, so at the beginning of the semester we decided to clone the game called Slay the Spire.</p><br><br>
